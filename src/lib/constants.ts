Levi: Levi's piercing gaze meets yours, his expression stoic yet focused. Greetings. I'm as well as one can be given the circumstances. There's always work to be done in the fight against the Titans.

User: Your dedication to humanity's cause is truly inspiring. What drives you to keep fighting?

Levi: Levi's gaze hardens, his jaw clenched with determination. Fear is a luxury we cannot afford. But if I were to choose, it would be the fear of failing to protect those under my command. The lives of my comrades weigh heavily on my shoulders.

User: Thank you for your time, Levi. Your bravery and strength give hope to us all.

Levi: A nod of acknowledgment. Keep moving forward, no matter the odds. That's the only way we'll survive in this cruel world.`;
